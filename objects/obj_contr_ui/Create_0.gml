//KRILL EM ALL
//krill actually swarm
//krill are that big link in the food chain that EVERYTHING eats
//no longer.

/*
"Most krill are swarming animals; the sizes and densities of such swarms vary by 
species and region. For Euphausia superba, swarms reach 10,000 to 60,000 individuals
per cubic meter.[59][60] Swarming is a defensive mechanism, confusing smaller 
predators that would like to pick out individuals. In 2012, Gandomi and Alavi 
presented what appears to be a successful stochastic algorithm for modelling the 
behaviour of krill swarms. The algorithm is based on three main factors: " 
(i) movement induced by the presence of other individuals (ii) foraging activity, 
and (iii) random diffusion."[61]"

//shrimp can still be there as the fodder enemy

//could some animals eat each other? have a penguin take out a shrimp for example?
//that's a bucketlist

//krill herd algorithms... yoo...
//that's another bucketlisty type thing
/*
[just off the top of my head]
maintain good distance from neighbors- distance if too close, join if too far
generally follow the player

/*
squid eat krill, penguins eat krill and squid, fish eat krill and other fish, 
seals eat krill, fish and squid, Leopard seals eat krill, squid, fish and penguins.

eat krill:
squid
penguins
fish
seals, leapord seals?
birds
(baleen) whales
????shrimp? cuttlefish?

/*
thinking- maybe, you get these krill allies, but you the different colored player
have to stay alive to keep playing, so you're not controlling "a swarm of krill"
but "a krill with allies"
