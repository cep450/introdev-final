hi pass filter on shrimp music for title
lo pass filter for game


what incentive is there to STOP firing?
	maybe, have delay on firing
	also, as the game goes on it should turn into like...
	you're the conductor of the krill mass you've accumulated


make it a bullet hell via lots of fish


- camera zooms out the bigger your swarm!!!!!!!! sense of progression, they used this
in agar.io, AND allows for really big swarm sizes
a smooth or discrete function??
if discrete- use common sizes-
Mode Name	Resolution
90p	    160x90
180p	320x180
240p	352x240
360p	640x360
720p	1280x720
1080p	1920x1080

this would make spawning more interesting. i guess would spawn stuff outside the window,
whatever the window is.


give your krill a little bit of a sinusoidal ebb and flow when you're idle
swimmming/pressing any keys this doesnt do this cause we want to prioritise player control,
but if you're not pressing any keys- makes it look nice
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
i could have a global ebb/flow
where the position on the sine is modulated by x value
so globally it's like there's actual waves rippling through the game
(plus some noise- noise applied to the x value perhaps?)


combos?
combos per enemy type? oo...
swarm size as a score multipler?


corpses flip over and sink to the bottom. they maintain (half?) their x velocity and are
affected by the sinusoidal ebb/flow.





wishlist
- pressing/releasing the mouse does an actual multi frame bouncy animation between states


far out bucketlist/if i were to continue this
- legitimate swarming behavior
- other creatures can eat each other ex. fish and birds will also eat shrimp
- more krill allows you to use other weapons/powers;; 'expend' krill??
- bigger krill swarms
- spacial audio depending on where on screen

Save hi scores to a local document

text/score/stat displays do a lil bounce when theyâ€™re increased or changed

Other enemies- seals, penguins

Test out- fixed screen or moving window
Test out- player ownership transfers to other shrimp vs your unkillable shrimp until theyre all dead


Usually these kind of effect is achieved by a few 'hair' objects that follow each other, while the first is anchored to the head, and are affected by gravity independently. You will find some discussions around if you search for Celeste's hair trick.

//KRILL EM ALL
//krill actually swarm
//krill are that big link in the food chain that EVERYTHING eats
//no longer.

/*
"Most krill are swarming animals; the sizes and densities of such swarms vary by 
species and region. For Euphausia superba, swarms reach 10,000 to 60,000 individuals
per cubic meter.[59][60] Swarming is a defensive mechanism, confusing smaller 
predators that would like to pick out individuals. In 2012, Gandomi and Alavi 
presented what appears to be a successful stochastic algorithm for modelling the 
behaviour of krill swarms. The algorithm is based on three main factors: " 
(i) movement induced by the presence of other individuals (ii) foraging activity, 
and (iii) random diffusion."[61]"

//shrimp can still be there as the fodder enemy

//could some animals eat each other? have a penguin take out a shrimp for example?
//that's a bucketlist

//krill herd algorithms... yoo...
//that's another bucketlisty type thing
/*
[just off the top of my head]
maintain good distance from neighbors- distance if too close, join if too far
generally follow the player


*/

/*
squid eat krill, penguins eat krill and squid, fish eat krill and other fish, 
seals eat krill, fish and squid, Leopard seals eat krill, squid, fish and penguins.
squid, Killer whales eat squid, fish, penguins, seals and other whales.
*/

/*
eat krill:
squid
penguins
fish
seals, leapord seals?
birds
(baleen) whales
????shrimp? cuttlefish?

*/


/*
thinking- maybe, you get these krill allies, but you the different colored player
have to stay alive to keep playing, so you're not controlling "a swarm of krill"
but "a krill with allies"
